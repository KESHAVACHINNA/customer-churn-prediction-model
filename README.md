   # Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn. The goal is to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) based on features like their tenure, monthly charges, total charges, and service type. This model is deployed using Flask to create an interactive web application where users can input customer data and get a prediction.

## Features
- **Customer Data Input:** Users can enter customer details like tenure, monthly charges, etc.
- **Prediction:** The model predicts if the customer is likely to churn or not.
- **Simple Flask Web App:** A user-friendly form for input and result display.
